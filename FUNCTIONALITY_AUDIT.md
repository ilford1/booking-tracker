2. **Advanced Filtering** - Add filter UI and logic to all list pages
3. **File Upload** - Connect file upload to creator avatars and deliverables

### **Low Priority**

## 📝 **SUMMARY**

**Overall Completion: ~75%**

The app has excellent foundational architecture and most core features are implemented. The main issues are:

1. **Database needs to be setup first** (blocking all functionality)
2. **Theme system is completely missing** despite UI being there
3. **Mobile experience is broken** (no mobile navigation)
4. **Some UI elements are placeholders** (search, quick actions, notifications)

Once the database is setup and these key missing pieces are added, you'll have a fully functional production-ready application!
